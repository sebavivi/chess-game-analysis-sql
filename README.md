## üìñ Introduction

This project is a deep dive into a dataset of online chess games, conducted entirely through SQL queries. The primary goal was to practice and showcase advanced SQL skills for data exploration, segmentation, and aggregation to answer specific analytical questions.

The analysis focuses on understanding patterns related to game outcomes, player ratings, opening moves, and top player performance.

## ‚ùì Analytical Questions

This project sought to answer the following questions using SQL:

1.  What percentage of games are won by White, and what percentage end in a draw?
2.  What are the most common first moves in games won by Black, and separately, in games won by White?
3.  What percentage of games are won by the player with the higher rating? Does this vary depending on the color they play?
4.  Which user has won the most games, and in what percentage of their victories did they have a higher rating than their opponent?
